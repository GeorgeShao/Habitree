# Habitree

##For the 2020 StreamHacks hackathon, we were prompted to make a solution for the following theme:
> Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, humanityâ€™s negative impact on the environment has weakened. 
> As the pandemic slows down, how can we use technology to help the environment recover from the human footprint?

### We built a web application called "Habitree" where you are provided your own virtual environment that grows when you include better habits and stick to them!
###You are responsible for your own virtual environment. Taking care of the real environment around you will help your own environment grow as well. When you stick to your habits which you want to improve in yourself, you can come on to Habitree to write and select the habits which you are committing and sticking to which will help your virtual environment grow. If not, you won't see the grand potential your environment holds and what it can grow into!\
